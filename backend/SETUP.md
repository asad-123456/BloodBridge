# BloodBridge Backend — Local Setup

## 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- PostgreSQL 16 with the **PostGIS** extension available (`postgresql-16-postgis-3` on Ubuntu/Debian)

Or just use the bundled compose file: `docker compose up -d` gives you PostGIS on
5432 and Adminer on 8080.

## 2. Install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Configure environment
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Only two variables are mandatory:
- `DATABASE_URL` — e.g. `postgresql://bloodbridge_user:bloodbridge_pass@localhost:5432/bloodbridge`
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY` — any long random string

Everything else has a default. `MAIL_*` and `CLOUDINARY_*` are optional: with
them blank the app still starts, email is logged as skipped, and upload
endpoints return 503. For local work without SMTP set
`REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=false`, otherwise donors and requestors can never
complete verification and so can never log in.

`ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` are the permanent admin login. The separate
`DEMO_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `DEMO_ADMIN_PASSWORD` pair is intended only for local UI
demos. Both accounts are hardcoded server credentials and have no DB row.
Admin login returns 503 while either is blank.

## 4. Create the database
```sql
CREATE USER bloodbridge_user WITH PASSWORD 'bloodbridge_pass';
CREATE DATABASE bloodbridge OWNER bloodbridge_user;
```
PostGIS is enabled automatically on migration and on app startup
(`ensure_postgis()` in `src/utils/database.py`) — no manual `CREATE EXTENSION`
needed, as long as the DB user has permission.

## 5. Run migrations
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```
This creates all 8 tables (`donors`, `requestors`, `hospitals`, `organizations`,
`blood_requests`, `request_matches`, `chat_threads`, `chat_messages`) plus
PostGIS's own `spatial_ref_sys`, then applies the hardening revision
(`a7f3c9d21b84`) that adds CHECK constraints and indexes.

> On a database that already has rows, the CHECK constraints are validated
> against existing data. Clean up any `blood_requests` / `request_matches` row
> that has both — or neither — of its two owner columns set before upgrading.

**When you change a model** (add a field, a table, etc.):
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe your change"
alembic upgrade head
```

## 6. Run the server
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
Visit `http://localhost:8001/docs` for interactive Swagger docs.

> The login endpoints take a JSON body, not OAuth2 form data. Call
> `POST /donors/login` (or the relevant role's login) via *Try it out*, copy the
> `access_token`, then click **Authorize** and paste the raw token into the
> single **Value** box — Swagger sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

## What's implemented
- **donors / requestors**: signup, email verification (+ resend), login (JWT),
  password reset, profile updates, Cloudinary picture upload
- **donors**: push device-token registration (`PATCH /donors/me/device-token`,
  send `null` to unregister)
- **hospitals / organizations**: signup, admin-approval-gated login, logo upload
- **admin**: hardcoded login, approve/reject pending hospitals and organizations
- **blood_requests**: create (auto-detects hospital-backed vs. not), hospital
  verify (accept/reject), PostGIS nearby search for donors (blood-type
  compatible, radius by urgency), cancel, widen radius, reactivate, close,
  admin-triggered expiry and auto-widen sweeps
- **scheduled sweeps**: expire-overdue and auto-widen run on a timer in-process
  every `SWEEP_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (see `src/utils/scheduler.py`); the admin
  endpoints stay available for on-demand runs. Set `ENABLE_SCHEDULER=false` to
  turn the timer off.
- **notification targeting**: `find_donors_to_notify()` in
  `src/blood_requests/notifications.py` resolves the eligible, in-radius donors
  with a registered device token when a request goes active, when a hospital
  approves one, and when a sweep widens one's radius. The send itself is a
  logged intent (`Would notify N donors about request ...`) until there is a
  frontend handing out real tokens.
- **request_matches**: accept (atomic — race-condition safe, and re-validates
  blood-type compatibility + distance), update ETA, cancel (reopens the
  request), mark complete (settles the request to `fulfilled`), list mine
- **chat**: auto-created thread per match, REST history + send, live WebSocket
  at `/chat/ws/{match_id}?token=...`

## Security & access model

**Who can read a blood request** (`GET /blood-requests/{id}`) — the endpoint
requires authentication, and patient name plus contact number are only returned
to:

| Viewer | Condition |
|---|---|
| Poster | the requestor or organization that created it |
| Hospital | the hospital named on the request |
| Admin | always |
| Donor | blood-type compatible **and** inside the current radius, while the request is open |
| Organization | inside the current radius (a blood bank holds many types) |
| Anyone who committed | permanently, once they have a match on it |

Everyone else gets a **404**, not a 403, so request IDs can't be probed to
confirm that a patient exists.

Other things worth knowing:
- Accepting a request re-checks compatibility and distance server-side. The
  nearby feed filters the same way, but a filtered list is not an
  authorization check.
- One open commitment per donor/organization per request, enforced both in the
  controller and by a partial unique index.
- A password reset invalidates every access token issued before it, and the
  reset link itself is single-use.
- `REJECTED`, `CANCELLED` and `CLOSED` requests cannot be reactivated —
  reopening a hospital-rejected request would bypass verification.
- Rate limits are in-process (slowapi, in-memory). They reset on restart and
  are per-worker; behind a proxy, set `TRUST_PROXY=true`.
- The chat WebSocket broadcaster is also per-process, so with multiple uvicorn
  workers a live message only reaches sockets on the same worker. REST history
  stays authoritative.
- The sweep scheduler is per-process too: every worker would run its own copy.
  The sweeps are idempotent, so that is safe rather than wrong, but with
  `--workers N` set `ENABLE_SCHEDULER=false` on all but one.

## Not yet built
- Donor eligibility (90-day) enforcement
- Donor cancellation-rate tracking
- Actually sending push notifications. Who to notify is resolved and logged
  (`find_donors_to_notify()`); the FCM call is a `TODO` in
  `src/blood_requests/notifications.py`, waiting on a frontend to register real
  device tokens.
- Automated tests
